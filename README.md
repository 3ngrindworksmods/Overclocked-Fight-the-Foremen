# Toontown: The Grindworks


This is a single-player game based on Disney's Toontown Online developed in the Godot Engine.

## Requirements

- Godot v4.3

## Setup

This project does have some import issues that will likely occur upon first boot. In order to fix them, simply boot into the project, and run the game. You will likely get several changed files after doing so. Just discard the changed files and restart the Godot editor, and the issues should be fixed.
